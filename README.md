## Few words about the project

This is React based SPA application that uses a Firebase to fetch JSON collections and Firestore files.
This codebase will be further developer because it is currently only MVP version with the most necessary logic.<br/>
If you have any improvements ideas, just let me know. I would like to hear about that!

## Project structure is divided into several modules:

`/config` directory that includes necessary project configuration, like:
- firebase config that specifies types of connections that are enabled
- shared components' registry e.g. drawers
- inversify container with its related dictionaries

`/core` directory that encapsulates crucial logic like:
- services
- routing
- firebase methods
- events handling
- Redux Toolkit store

`/modules` directory that includes application structure:
- Reusable atomic components
- React components and views
- Custom hooks with components' inner logic
- Typescript contracts
- Modular context e.g. store, routing, etc.

`/scss` directory that includes all stylesheets that reflects project structure

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
